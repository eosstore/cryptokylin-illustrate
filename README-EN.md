CryptoKylin Testnet simulates an on-chain test environment for developers on EOS, which is maintained and given feedback by members from CrytoKylin Group. Developers could gain support via issue section in Github once they find any problem arising from the use of the Testnet. Our telegram group also welcome discussions of these kind of issues.

CryptoKylin Group is comprised of core technical experts from various BPs (EOS block producer) who fully engaged in and witnessed the EOS mainnet launch. That means they have an in-depth study on the relative process of EOS mainnet launch, BP node architecture, network security, smart contract, blockchain explorer and EOS wallet. Members of the Group will go further and code on following technical aspects: system contract customization, side-chain(cross-chain) technology, high performance network and IPFS storage.
